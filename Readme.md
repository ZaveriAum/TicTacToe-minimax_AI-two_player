# TicTacToe-Java

## Introduction
Tic Tac Toe (also known as Noughts and Crosses) is a classic turn-based game for two players. This project implements a fully functional Tic Tac Toe application written in Java, offering two gaming modes:

- **Two-Player Mode**: Players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid.
- **AI Mode**: One player competes against a simple artificial intelligence opponent.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later
- An integrated development environment (IDE), such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans

## Installation & Usage
To run the Tic Tac Toe application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZaveriAum/TicTacToe-minimax_AI-two_player.git
```
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

3. Locate and run the main entry point of the application, which should be in a class named Main or similar.

4. Choose the desired game mode from the provided menu.

## Game Modes

### Two-Player Mode
In this mode, two human players take turns making moves on the console interface until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.

### AI Mode
The AI mode allows a single player to compete against a computer opponent using a basic decision-making algorithm. The AI difficulty level may vary depending on the implemented strategy.
